# Machine learning for warehousing: volume prediction

The purpose of this project is to attempt to predict volume in the warehouse handling process, per SKU.

ABC analysis is based on historical data, resource planning is based on customer forecasts and productivity models.
Knowing the quantities and products that are in demand helps to reduce waste in the process. Good ABC is a great boost to productivity because much more output is achieved for the same amount of effort.
